# Coevolved Sumobots


## About
This project applies concepts from within the field of coevolution to evolve complex robot behavior within the context of a "Sumo" fighting ring. Specifically, this project uses the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to evolve the structure of the neural networks that are used to control our sumobots.

## Dependencies
- Python 2.7
- ROS Melodic
- Gazebo
